    My name is Lindsay S. Shaffer and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University's Department of Psychology with a concentration in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience. My advisor is Dr. Jim Thompson. I am also a NSF NRT Fellow through the Center for Adaptive Systems of Brain-Body Interactions (CASBBI).
    <p>My research primarily focuses on investigating the neural bases of decision-making in humans. My work strongly focuses on the anatomical and functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex. I incorporate techniques such as reinforcement learning tasks, fMRI, EEG, and computational modeling.
    <p>I'm also strongly interested in efforts improving patient outcomes and precision medicine initiatives. As a part of my NSF NRT Fellowship, I'm currently collaborating with members of the S.T.A.R. Lab, the Biomedical Imaging Lab, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the INOVA Parkinson's and Movement Disorders Clinic to develop a novel application that can remotely measure symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPs) and easily disseminated to the PwP's care team.
    <p>Mentorship is an important element of my professional career. I currently mentor a M.A. student and 2 Ph.D. students in the NSF NRT program. I previously mentored 9 undergraduate research assistants, 4 Master's students, and 2 early-stage Ph.D. students. My former mentees come from various departments such as clinical psychology, neuroscience, computer science, social work, kinesiology, and mathematics. In 2023, Goerge Mason University awarded me with a Mentoring Excellence Award in recognition in my efforts in training the next generation of scientists.
    <p>When I'm not on the academic grind, I enjoy spending time with my husband, daughter, and dog. I also enjoy playing videogames, hiking, crochet, knitting, singing, and working with computers. I am an unapologetic pro-wrestling fan.
