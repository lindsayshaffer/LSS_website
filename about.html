    My name is Lindsay S. Shaffer and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University's Department of Psychology with a concentration in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience. My advisor is Dr. Jim Thompson. I am also a NSF NRT Fellow through the Center for Adaptive Systems of Brain-Body Interactions (CASBBI).
    <p>My research primarily focuses on investigating the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and the role of the prefrontal cortex in this process. Specifically, I investigate what kind of information is determined to be task-relevant and how this information is represented in the brain. Understanding what kind of information we determine to be relevant to how we make decisions have implications for how we characterize deficits in decision-making found in several psychiatric diseases.
