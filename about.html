    My name is Lindsay S. Shaffer and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University's Department of Psychology with a concentration in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience. My advisor is Dr. Jim Thompson. I am also a NSF NRT Fellow through the Center for Adaptive Systems of Brain-Body Interactions (CASBBI).
    <p>My research primarily focuses on investigating the neural contributions of the prefrontal cortex toward decision-making within humans. I investigate how sensory and affective information converge in certain regions of the prefrontal cortex and how the convergence of this information gives rise to behavior guided by cognitive maps. I am also interested in how distributed and overlapping networks which convey sensory and affective information broadly suggest the prefrontal cortex is organized in a hierarchical fashion.
    <p>When I'm not on the academic grind, I enjoy spending time with my husband, daughter, and dog. I also enjoy playing videogames, hiking, crochet, knitting, singing, and working with computers. I am an unapologetic pro-wrestling fan.
